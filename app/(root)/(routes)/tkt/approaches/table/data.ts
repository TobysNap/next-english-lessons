      'Language is learnt by using it. Classroom activities are based around a series of problem-solving tasks.',

    viewOfLearning:
      'Language is learnt by first seeing new language in a context which shows its meaning, practicing it in controlled and guided conditions, then using it in freer conditions which give the learner less language support.',
    classroomPractices:
      'Lessons move from the presentation stage to the practice stage to the production stage. Learners should not be allowed to make mistakes during the practice stage. Typical activities include situational presentations, miming, drills, role-plays, and information-gap activities.',

      'Vocabulary is the most important aspect of language. Vocabulary consists of individual words and different kinds of chunks such as collocations, idioms, fixed expressions.',
    viewOfLearning:
      'Language is learnt by learning chunks as whole and complete units. Chunks need to be noticed by learners in order to be learnt; learners need to become aware of chunks and focus on them.',
    classroomPractices:
      'The syllabus focuses on lexis. Learners work with authentic written or spoken texts, noticing chunks, and carrying out tasks involving the use of chunks.',

    viewOfLearning: 'Same as PPP.',
    classroomPractices:
      "The syllabus focuses on functions usually graded according to their frequency of use in practical daily life and to learners' communicative needs. The Functional Approach often makes use of PPP stages in lessons or communicative activities.",

    viewOfLanguage:
      'Communication is the most important aspect of language. Meaning is communicated through functions, grammar, vocabulary, discourse, and skills.',
    viewOfLearning:
      'The best way to learn language is to use it in interaction, rather than to learn about it.',
    classroomPractices:
      "The syllabus focuses on tasks, functions, and topic areas based on learners' communicative needs. Pair and group work enable lots of interaction in the classroom. Fluency is more important than accuracy, and authentic materials are often used. Learners become active users of the language, and the teacher's role focuses on setting up communicative activities, providing correction after fluency activities, and inputting language when needed.",
